Lab5 doc
I spend one week to finish this project, five days for DMA, two for
others.
The doc of DMA is too long to see for me. However i did it at
last. And the bug was strange and hard to find reason because i
doesn't know this vary well.
The bug of DMA I found as last was a ptr table address error. When i
set ptr table address for bus master, I used a virtual address in outb
function, which actually should be a physical address. So i waste a
lot time to check other right code.

Solution for exercise 4:
After handling a dma interrupt, I should send a EOI to PIC to tell it
the end of interrupt. The code is like this:
    outb(0xA0, 0x20);

The other was easy and I finished it quickly.Just finished the code as
the ask is ok. And at last, i got a problem when did exercise
13. After spwan function, the child process has a
right data segment but a wrong dss segment, the hash value of it was
0xc6900000 ! For passing the test script I add a memset() in spwan to
clear the bss segment. Maybe there are some other bugs...

No challenge was done, because no time.
